User should be able to create a new token by clicking a button on the right side of the screen.
Token should appear in the center of the gameboard - above the map.
Token should be a Quad with a random color based on the Token ID.

Token ID:
Peer that creates it needs to reserve the ID for the token upon creation.
That ID needs to be the same among all peers.
The ID needs to be unique from all other token IDs.

Just Using UUID v4 for now. May want to use V1 or V6 when you have a player's identifier
